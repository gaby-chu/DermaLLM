Omg I\\u2019m so happy to finally see this available at Sephora! I adore this scalp sunscreen! The scent is amazing and coola if you\\u2019re reading this please make this scent available in other forms. It smells like a fresh woodsy beachy salty vibe, kind of in the same vein as Jo Malone wood sage and sea salt but like more fresh and light, perfect for days on the beach. My scalp never burns when using this product but as someone with thin hair I have absolutely applied too much and had some greasy looking hair but that is 100% user error lol highly recommend! I\\u2019ve purchased many times from other retailers. ; 2. I love this product!! I burn super easily (including my scalp) and it causes my hairline to flake and become super itchy. This hair mist allowed me to be outside for hours in a high uv index and my scalp didn\\u2019t burn at all!! Love this product sm and it does not leave a greasy or weird film at all. ; 3. Doesn\\u2019t leave my hair greasy and it works! My scalp is so sensitive to the sun but this protects it wonderfully! If it is making your hair greasy I suggest spraying it a little farther away from your head. I\\u2019m so glad Sephora sells this now! ; 4. I went skiing on a bluebird sky day at high altitude.  A hat would have been too hot on a 40\\u00b0F day.   I sprayed this on my scalp and no burnt scalp at the end of the day.  This product is a game changer for me.\",\n          \"1. The Augustinus Bader Eye Cream with TFC8 is excellent. I\\u2019m a 46-year-old woman and used it twice a day for a month and am pleased with the results. Any fine lines I had are smoothed, my skin seems more elastic, my undereye area is hydrated (concealer is applying flawlessly), and it reduced any puffiness I had. The only thing the cream did not help is to eliminate my dark circles; sadly, those are still there, but I\\u2019ve never found anything to reduce those. The packaging is super luxe--the cream itself is in a golden vial which is then sheathed in a heavy cup to hold it upright. I wondered if you could put the cup in the refrigerator to cool the cream a little, but was afraid to do so in case it changed the molecular makeup of the ingredients. The cream is very lightweight! At first, I wondered if it would be effective since it was so lightweight, but don\\u2019t let its delicate consistency fool you--it\\u2019s a powerhouse. I ended up loving how it glided on and absorbed so quickly. Unlike my other creams, I could apply makeup right away--no waiting time with this guy. It is hydrating and seemed effective at fighting the signs of aging for me so I would definitely recommend the cream for those comfortable purchasing in this price range. ; 2. I was very impressed by the luxurious blue design and packaging. I was confused that the bottle came out separately from the outer container but come to find out that it\\u2019s refillable and recyclable. I was very skeptical. It\\u2019s a lightweight lotion like cream that dispenses from a pump. I dabbed it around my eyes twice daily. I didn\\u2019t think it would absorb fast due to the consistency, but it did. I loved the way it felt around my eyes. There was no irritation at all. I really loved that part. I have never used this brand before and heard so much about it. I tried to deny it, but my eyes looked revived. Amazingly, I noticed my dark circles and puffiness go down. I actually saw RESULTS!!! I am surprisingly very impressed. Would I purchase this $215 eye cream? I have tried lots of eye creams and would get some results. This eye cream was seriously magical to me. The most results I\\u2019ve had from all the eye creams. For me, the answer would be YES!!! ; 3. I love the Augustinus Bader brand so I was excited for the eye cream. The packaging on this is gorgeous but bulky since the eye cream comes in a glass jar. I took it out of the glass container and have it laying in my skincare drawer. Now the cream has a nice texture and it lightweight. Not too heavy which is perfect. I have noticed a slight difference, only using it every single night. There\\u2019s no dramatic cure all for under eye circles with this but in terms of firming I have found this to be mildly effective. ; 4. I received this product for free from Augustinus Bader and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product for the past month. The eye cream packaging is very luxurious and it was a very special experience to open it. The cream itself is in a small tube. The price point of this cream is very high, but I have noticed a huge difference in the fine lines around my eyes since using this product. I am 32 and just starting to see noticeable crows feet. The lines are visibly diminished. Weirdly, I have also received more complements on my skin since using this product. I wish I had taken before and after photos! I love that this product is clean and backed by science. Although it is expensive, I would and have recommended this product to my friends. I will very likely try more of the Augustinus Bader line in the future. ; 5. The title says it. I\\u2019ve tried many eye creams and serums \\u2013 this one is my absolute favorite. I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes. This cream is gentle yet effective. It has no noticeable scent and it absorbs well, leaving no noticeable oily residue. I highly recommend for anyone with undereye bags, sensitive skin, or dark circles. I\\u2019ve noticed a marked improvement since I started using it a couple weeks ago. I already have decreased puffiness and fine lines. I will definitely purchase.\",\n          \"1. I love this. A nice clay mask that tightens skin, dries quickly & doubles as a scrub when you wash it off. Also, a little goes a long way!! ; 2. After using this product, I\\u2019ve visibly noticed smaller pores and clearer skin. My face feels great after using this. ; 3. Excellent produit qui nettoie en profondeur et qui d\\u00e9loge les impuret\\u00e9s...je le recommande!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":44},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/jupyter_client/session.py:203: DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future version.
