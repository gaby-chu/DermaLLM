## Architecture

The A2UI flow disconnects the generation of UI from the execution of UI:

1. **Generation:** An Agent (using Gemini or another LLM) generates or uses
a pre-generated `A2UI Response`, a JSON payload describing the composition
of UI components and their properties.
2. **Transport:** This message is sent to the client application
(via A2A, AG UI, etc.).
3. **Resolution:** The Client's **A2UI Renderer** parses the JSON.
4. **Rendering:** The Renderer maps the abstract components
(e.g., `type: 'text-field'`) to the concrete implementation in the client's codebase.

## Dependencies

A2UI is designed to be a lightweight format, but it fits into a larger ecosystem:

* **Transports:** Compatible with **A2A Protocol** and **AG UI**.
* **LLMs:** Can be generated by any model capable of generating JSON output.
* **Host Frameworks:** Requires a host application built in a supported framework
(currently: Web or Flutter).

## Getting Started

The best way to understand A2UI is to run the samples.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (for web clients)
* Python (for agent samples)
* A valid [Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/) is required for the samples.

### Running the Restaurant Finder Demo

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/A2UI.git
    cd A2UI
    ```

2. **Set your API Key:**

    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
    ```

3. **Run the Agent (Backend):**

    ```bash
    cd samples/agent/adk/restaurant_finder
    uv run .
    ```

4. **Run the Client (Frontend):**
    Open a new terminal window:

    ```bash
    cd samples/client/lit/shell
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

For Flutter developers, check out the [GenUI SDK](https://github.com/flutter/genui),
which uses A2UI under the hood.

CopilotKit has a public [A2UI Widget Builder](https://go.copilotkit.ai/A2UI-widget-builder)
to try out as well.
